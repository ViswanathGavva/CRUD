# CRUD

# To run
Clone or Down load
run  npm install
run bower install
npm run 
OR
node server.js

Disclaimers:
1) The form has a data element and we need to perform some validations for this. I wrote some js validatioans but they will fail in corner cases.  Ideally we should be using a library like moment.js for these
2) I wrote only a couple of unit tests and E2E tests
3) The validations are not perfect. I used HTML5 inouts so i tried to use the default validations.
4) The directive can be better
