# CRUD

# To run
1) Clone or Down load
2) run  npm install
3) run bower install
4)npm run 
  OR
  node server.js
Note: Make sure you have the latest npm else the json-server (dummy rest api) will take forever to install.
npm install npm@latest -g

Disclaimers:
1) The form has a data element and we need to perform some validations for this. I wrote some js validatioans but they will fail in corner cases.  Ideally we should be using a library like moment.js for these
2) I wrote only a couple of unit tests and E2E tests
3) The validations are not perfect. I used HTML5 inouts so i tried to use the default validations.
4) The directive can be better
